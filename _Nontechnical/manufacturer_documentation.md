# A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation from the Manufacturer


{% include openExamples.html %} 
{:latex-ignore="true"}

**The ability for the manufacturer and/or the manufacturer&#39;s supporting entity, to create, gather, disseminate, and store information relevant to cybersecurity of the IoT device prior to customer purchase, and throughout the development of a device and its subsequent lifecycle.**


Documentation of cybersecurity information helps potential IoT device customers to make informed purchase decisions that support their organization&#39;s cybersecurity requirements for IoT devices and/or systems where they are used. Documentation of important cybersecurity information also then helps enable secure use of the IoT device by customers after the purchase since it serves as the source of information for customers.

Documentation is also important to support legal requirements (regulatory, contractual, web site security and privacy policies, etc.), for audits or other certifications that some customers may require for the IoT devices they use, and/or to support due diligence activities. Documentation about maintenance requirements, especially regarding the supporting entities contracted by the manufacturer to perform maintenance, device changes, and other activities, also supports the customer&#39;s need to adequately plan for maintenance activities.

This section of capabilities includes non-technical communications and actions that manufacturers can provide to support potential and existing IoT device customers&#39; needs related to

1. complying with their own organizational policies and applicable legal requirements for determining the risks created by IoT devices,
2. understanding how implementing the IoT device will possibly introduce risks into their processing system(s), and
3. describing the supporting actions and information the IoT device manufacturer will provide.


The term &quot;establish communications&quot; is used throughout this section to mean developing, documenting, implementing, distributing/providing, and maintaining the documentation and performing the actions involved with the non-technical capabilities.

## 1). &nbsp;&nbsp;Document assumptions made during the development process and other expectations related to the IoT device.
