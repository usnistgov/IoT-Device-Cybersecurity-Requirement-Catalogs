# **B.   Information Dissemination – From the Manufacturer and/or Supporting Entity**

**The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to broadcast and distribute information related to cybersecurity of the IoT device.**

This capability supports on-going cybersecurity of the device by keeping customers informed of developments and new information after the initial documentation was developed and provided.

Customer organizations may need to be informed about cybersecurity-related activities on the IoT device, especially if the IoT device is critical to their operations. Customer organizations will want to stay informed about the cybersecurity of IoT devices to allow them to fine tune their mitigations and maintain an adequate level of risk assurance.

Customer organizations may need to know the security practices of the manufacturer and/or supporting entities that have made or will have occasional or ongoing access to the IoT devices to enable them to ensure the other parties do not unacceptably add to the customer&#39;s cybersecurity risk. Customer organizations may need to maintain a history of such documentation that may then be considered when situations arise where other types of IoT devices are proposed to replace the existing IoT device. Customer organizations may also want to view security certifications, accreditations and evaluations for what is typically third-party assurance of acceptable information describing cyber, networking, applications, and related security practices.

Customer organizations can use the associated documentation to support their evaluation of the adequacy of the security provided by the manufacturer and/or supporting entities and related IoT device. Customer organizations who must ensure IoT devices comply with the associated laws and regulations for which they are covered can use the documentation to support their IoT purchase decisions and risk assessments.
