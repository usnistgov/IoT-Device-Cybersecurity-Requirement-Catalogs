# D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and Awareness from Manufacturers/Supporting Entities

**The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to create awareness of, and educate IoT device customers about, cybersecurity-related information, considerations, features, and other information related to reducing the risks created by the IoT device being implemented within the IoT customer&#39;s digital ecosystem.**

This capability supports secure provisioning and on-going cybersecurity support for using the IoT device. For IoT devices with a wide range of use cases, some customers may need more education than others to securely provision and use the device. The complexities of IoT systems, devices, and use cases makes it important for manufacturers to create awareness and educate customers about cybersecurity risks, capabilities, and related issues for their IoT devices.

Manufacturers and/or their supporting entities can provide education to IoT device customers covering a wide range of topics, and determine the content of IoT device customer security training and awareness based on such factors as the specific organizational requirements of IoT device customers, the purpose of and capabilities within the IoT device, and other topics as determined by the results of the manufacturer performing an IoT device risk assessment and taking into consideration the questions and concerns communicated to them from their customers, through the activities in capability B. Manufacturer Information and Query Reception. For example, growing numbers of regulations and laws also require manufacturers and/or their supporting entities to provide customers with access to the data that the IoT device manufacturer and/or supporting entities possess about them, and also to make such data portable so that customers can take that data and use it elsewhere. Knowing how to obtain access to such data requires some type of education, including formal training possibilities or awareness information and/or activities. Education may occur through many forms; in-person, videos, online modules, training booklets, or some other form.
