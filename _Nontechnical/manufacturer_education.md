# D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and Awareness from Manufacturers/Supporting Entities

{% include openExamples.html %} 
{:latex-ignore="true"}

**The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to create awareness of, and educate IoT device customers about, cybersecurity-related information, considerations, features, and other information related to reducing the risks created by the IoT device being implemented within the IoT customer&#39;s digital ecosystem.**

This capability supports secure provisioning and on-going cybersecurity support for using the IoT device. For IoT devices with a wide range of use cases, some customers may need more education than others to securely provision and use the device. The complexities of IoT systems, devices, and use cases makes it important for manufacturers to create awareness and educate customers about cybersecurity risks, capabilities, and related issues for their IoT devices.
