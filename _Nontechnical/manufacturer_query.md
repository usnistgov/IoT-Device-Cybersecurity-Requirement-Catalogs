# B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacturer Information and Query Reception

{% include openExamples.html %} 
{:latex-ignore="true"}

**The ability for the manufacturer and/or supporting entity to receive from the customer information and queries related to cybersecurity of the IoT device.**

This capability provides an input for the manufacturer to use to gather cybersecurity related information about their IoT devices as they are being used by customers, revealing topics where there may be a need to provide additional customer training, along with tracking information provided to customers to answer their questions about securing the device. Such ongoing interactions have an important role in securing the IoT device and meeting customers&#39; cybersecurity needs and goals after purchase. These actions can also support a number of other cybersecurity supporting activities, including those within the Information Dissemination and Education and Awareness non-technical supporting sections of capabilities.

Customer organizations may also need to have such capabilities to meet organizational requirements related to conditions for making technology purchases, to support updates to management about how discovered problems or flaws within the IoT device are being addressed, and to maintain a history of documentation for specific IoT devices that could be considered when situations arise where other types of IoT devices are proposed to replace the existing IoT device.

Customer organizations and their third-parties may want, or be required by contract, law and/or policy, to report vulnerabilities to manufacturers that they identify in an IoT device, or the systems that interface with or are incompatible with the device. Manufacturers can use such reports of common queries and vulnerabilities to identify ways to improve the cybersecurity of the IoT device (e.g., development of software updates to patch reported vulnerabilities). For broadly used IoT devices, some customers may need additional support from the manufacturer to securely provision and use an IoT device.
