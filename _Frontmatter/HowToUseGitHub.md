# User Guide
# Providing Feedback on the Federal Profile via GitHub 

To View the Federal Profile: No GitHub account is needed to view this initial catalog of IoT device cybersecurity technical capabilities and non-technical capabilities which can be found here.  However, if you wish to provide feedback you can either submit feedback the traditional way to our NIST mailbox at: <IoTsecurity@nist.gov>, or:

You must establish a GitHub account to provide feedback directly through GitHub. In order to provide feedback through the GitHub “Issues” feature, you will need to create a GitHub account. 

This can be done by proceeding to <https://github.com/join>. If this is a personal account, GitHub allows you to remain pseudonymous if you would like, just make sure you select the options that suit you on the “Profile” and “Emails” pages of your “Personal Settings”. We also highly encourage you to turn on two-factor authentication in the “Security” page, also part of “Personal Settings”. For issues submitted on behalf of an organization, we prefer a generic account named for the organization, rather than a personal account from someone within the organization.
