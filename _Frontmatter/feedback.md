# NIST Needs Your Feedback 

We ask for your feedback on the material we have created. Please answer the following questions:

- For any given technical capability and sub-capability, have we identified the most common, or expected, device cybersecurity capability or sub-capability that should be built within an IoT device?
- Are there any common IoT device technical cybersecurity capabilities or sub-capabilities that we have not included? Please describe.
- Do you have any suggested updates or additions to elements of device cybersecurity capabilities and sub-capabilities, or suggestions for re-arranging the elements? Please describe.
- Are there any common IoT device non-technical manufacturer capabilities that we have not included? Please describe.
- Do you have any suggested updates or additions to the non-technical capabilities? Please describe.
- Do you find it useful to have the technical capabilities catalog separate from the non-technical capabilities? Why or why not?
- Is this structure (i.e., capability->sub-capability->element) useful for defining device cybersecurity capabilities?
- Would mapping the catalog elements to NISTIR 8259A, NIST SP 800-53 (rev 4 or rev 5) and/or the Cybersecurity Framework be helpful?
