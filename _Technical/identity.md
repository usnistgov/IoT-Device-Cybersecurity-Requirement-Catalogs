# Device Identification
 
The capability to identify the IoT device for multiple purposes and in multiple ways to meet organizational requirements.
 
## Identifier Management Support
 
Ability for device identification. Elements that may be necessary:
-	Ability to uniquely identify the IoT device logically.
-	Ability to uniquely identify a remote IoT device.
-	Ability for the device to support a unique device ID (e.g., to allow it to be linked to the person or process assigned to use the IoT device).
 
## Actions Based on Device Identity
 
Ability to perform actions that can occur based on or using the identity of the device. Elements that may be necessary:
-	Ability to configure IoT device access control policies using IoT device identity.
    -	Ability to hide IoT device identity from non-authorized entities.
    -	Ability for the IoT device to differentiate between authorized and unauthorized remote users.
    -	Ability for the IoT device to differentiate between authorized and unauthorized physical device users.
-	Ability to monitor specific actions based on the IoT device identity.
-	Ability to identify software loaded on the IoT device based on IoT device identity.
 
## Device Authentication Support
 
Ability to support local or interfaced device authentication. Elements that may be necessary:
-	Ability for the IoT device to identify itself as an authorized entity to other devices.
-	Ability to verify the identity of an IoT device.
 
## Physical Identifiers
 
Ability to add a unique physical identifier at an external or internal location on the device authorized entities can access.
